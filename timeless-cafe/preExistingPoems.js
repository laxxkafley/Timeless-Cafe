      content: `The stars were silent, the moon stood still,  
  In the quiet night, the world seemed ill.  
  Whispers of winds, with no place to go,  
  Gently kissed the earth below.
  
  The trees stood tall, with branches wide,  
  But in their leaves, no birds would hide.  
  The night, a blanket, soft and deep,  
  Where secrets of the world would sleep.

      content: `The wind speaks softly, a message unknown,  
  Through the trees, with a haunting tone.  
  It carries words from places afar,  
  Of dreams untold, and lives that spar.
  
  It whispers secrets from forgotten lands,  
  Held together by invisible hands.  
  And though we hear it, we cannot see,  
  What the wind wishes us to be.

      content: `Chasing the horizon, never to arrive,  
  In pursuit of dreams, we strive and dive.  
  The sun sets low, and shadows grow,  
  Yet still, we walk, through winds that blow.
  
  The world spins round, and we must follow,  
  Through valleys deep and mountains hollow.  
  But what we seek is not so near,  
  For the horizon fades, with every year.

  As night descends, we’ve come to know,  
  That in the stillness, we are whole,  
  Connected by the earth, body, and soul.
  
  The stars above, they gently speak,  
  Of all we’ve lost, and all we seek.  
  Yet still, beneath this endless dome,  
  We find ourselves, in the unknown.

  Through ancient walls and endless sea.  
  Whispers of lives that once were here,  
  Now only memories, faint and clear.
  
  The past is gone, yet it remains,  
  In every song, in every rain.  
  For time does not forget its track,  
  It echoes, and then it turns back.

        content: `Through endless skies and distant dreams,  
    The dreamer wanders, or so it seems.  
    With eyes that gleam, and heart that soars,  
    Seeking a world that's never before.
    
    The road is long, but full of light,  
    Each step is taken with pure delight.  
    And though the world may twist and turn,  
    The dreamer’s heart will always burn.

    As the dawn ushers in the light of day.  
    What once was dark, now shines so clear,  
    Yet in their fading, we hold them dear.
    
    For though they leave, their light remains,  
    Etched in our hearts, like ancient chains.  
    And when we look up, at night’s embrace,  
    We see the stars, in time and space.

    Where shadows hide, and secrets sleep.  
    Its waters carry the weight of time,  
    Worn by the hills, but always sublime.
    
    It whispers softly, to those who hear,  
    Of distant lands, of far and near.  
    And though it moves, with gentle grace,  
    The river stays, in its own place.

    To places far, across the sea.  
    It lifts me up, with gentle might,

    No walls to bind, no chains to hold,  
    The wind is free, and so I’m bold.  
    I spread my wings, and ride the breeze,  
    As free as air, as swift as seas.

    A golden horizon greets the night.  
    The world is vast, with endless skies,  
    Where every star holds a thousand lies.
    
    Yet in this vastness, there’s a way,  
    To find your peace, to seize the day.  
    For on the horizon, where the light does bend,  
    There is no beginning, nor end.
